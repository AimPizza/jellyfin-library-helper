# what can it do?
you can:
- Rename directories that have a name close enough that the api can recognise it.
- The directories are currently renamed to [Jellyfins recommendation](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/server/media/movies/).

# how to use
get the required python module

`pip install cinemagoer`

place the `main.py` somewhere you can access it (move path can be chosen from within the program) and run

`python /path/to/main.py`

# disclaimer
While I try my best to write _okay_ code, I am very much still starting to learn and therefore cannot guarantee failsave operation of the script. 
While it shouldn't corrupt any files, backups are always essential, especially when interacting with scripts like this.

# TODO
- [ ] example gif in readme
- [ ] configurable naming conventions
- [ ] some sort of a settings file (to keep a directory for long term use)
